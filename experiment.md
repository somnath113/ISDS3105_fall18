# Cognitive Anchoring of Color Cues on Online Review Ratings

This is the dataset collected for my poster at AMCIS 2017 ["Cognitive Anchoring of Color Cues on Online Review Ratings"](http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/HumanCI/Presentations/2/).

Dataset (negative results) - [link](https://github.com/DarioBoh/data/tree/master/colorAnchors)

The goal of the experiment is to test the effect of color cues in online review systems (e.g. TripAdvisor) on online review ratings. The experimental setting is a fictional online review experience (lab setting). The treatment consists in administering to the participants (college students) a fictional lodging experience that they have to review using rating scales with different color designs. The ratings expressed are for: Cleanliness, Room, Overall, Sleep Quality, Service, Value. 

The interface they used to rate the experience changes according to four treatment levels - [link to the webapp](https://dds.cct.lsu.edu/ddslab/websiteAMCIS2017/)


## Treatment

The interface for submitting the online review has four possible treatments:

1. *grey*: the selected score fills in grey when onclicked

2. *color*: the selected score fills with a color from red (score=1), to green (score=5) when oncliced

3. *green*: the selected score fills in grey when onclicked

4. *red*: the selected score fills in red when onclicked


## Manipulation Check

To control for colorblindess we used a reduced version of the [Ishihara's Test](http://www.colour-blindness.com/colour-blindness-tests/ishihara-colour-test-plates/).
