#' Complete the exercises on a new branch of your git repo. Once you are confident that your solutions are correct, merge the branch you created to your master branch. Follow this workflow:
#' 1. Save and commit everything up to now
#' 2. Create a new branch and switch to it `$ git checkout -b solutions` (`$ git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]` to switch between branches)
#' 3. Go back to your master `$ git checkout master` and merge it with `solutions` using `$ git merge solutions`
#' 4. After you merge, commit to master and push to GitHub



#' Complete to the following tasks and push the responses to your GitHub:
#' Create a character vector `family` with your family members' names
#' Create a vector `birth` with their birth years
#' Create another vector `age` with your family members' ages (calculated using `birth`)
#' Use `typeof()` to make sure that `family`, `birth`, and `age` are the appropriate type (character, integer/double, integer/double)
#' Use `names()` to name the elements of `age` with the family members' names from `family`
#' Use inline code `r ##` to print your name and age (using indexing)




#' Respond to the following questions and push the responses to your GitHub:
#' What happens when:
#' You extract using a positive index bigger than the vector length?
#' You subset by a name that doesn't exist?
#' You assign a number to position 20 of the age vector? 
  

#' Carefully read the documentation for `is.vector()`. If `is.vector(x)` retrieves `TRUE`, does it mean that `x` is an atomic vector?
